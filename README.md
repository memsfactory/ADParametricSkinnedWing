# ADParametricSkinnedWing

This is a work in progress. I do not know how to use GitHub. :0

Creates an OpensCAD parametric way to make thin sheeted wing sections similar to 3DLabprint.com   Most Openscad code did not loft arbitrary airfoil profiles (dat files).  By using BOSL2 and Scad-utils libraries, I think this possible now.  The code seems to work fine when the two airfoil sections DO NOT HAVE the same number of files.  

Requires use of scad-utils library and BOSL2 libraries.
